# Pig Latin Translator

## Description
The `pig_latin.py` is a Python program that accepts a sentence as input and translates it to a variant of Pig Latin. 

To convert from English to Pig Latin, each word must be transformed as follows:
- If the word begins with a vowel, ‘way’ should be appended (example: ‘apple’ becomes ‘appleway’)
- If the word begins with a sequence of consonants, this sequence should be moved to the end, prefixed with ‘a’ and followed by ‘ay’ (example: ‘please’ becomes ‘easeaplay’)

## How to Run
To run the program, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `pig_latin.py`, and type `python pig_latin.py`.
Alternately, if you have VS Code install python. Then select an interpreter by clicking Control+Shift+P and trying Python: Select Interpreter and choose one. Navigate to the directory containing `pig_latin.py` and run it.
